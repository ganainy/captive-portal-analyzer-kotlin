# Captive Portal Analyzer

## Overview

This app focuses on analyzing captive portals. It provides an interface for interacting with captive portals directly through the app by gathering POST request bodies, headers, creating sessions, capturing screenshots, and analyzing their data collection and privacy using AI-powered analysis. Additionally, the app allows uploading analyzed data for further examination by our team.
> **Note:** The app is designed to work with physical devices only since it interacts with real captive portals.

### ðŸ†• New Features: More AI Models & Fine-Grained File Control

You now have access to more Gemini AI models and detailed control over which files are included in the analysis. The `.pcap` file can also be converted to JSON and added to the AI prompt for better results.

## How to Run the App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ganainy/captive-portal-analyzer-kotlin.git
   ```

2. Set up API Keys and Configuration:

   a. **Gemini AI API Key:**
    - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
    - Create secrets.properties in the root directory of the project
   (the same level where local.properties and local.defaults.properties are located)
    - Add your Gemini AI API key to `secrets.properties` as follows:
      ```properties
      API_KEY_RELEASE="your_api_key_here"
      ```

   b. **Firebase Setup:**
    - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
    - Create a new project or select an existing one
    - Download the `google-services.json` file
    - Place `google-services.json` in the `app` directory

   c. **Server Setup for PCAP to JSON conversion:**
    - In `AutomaticAnalysisViewModel.kt`, update the `SERVER_UPLOAD_URL` and `SERVER_STATUS_URL_BASE` constants.
    - Ensure the server can accept the `.pcap` file and convert it to JSON format. For guidance, refer to:
      [AWS Server for PCAP to JSON Conversion](https://github.com/ganainy/aws-server-for-pcap-to-json-conversion)

3. Build and run the project on a physical device.
