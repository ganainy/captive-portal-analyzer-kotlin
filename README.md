# Captive Portal Analyzer

## Overview

This app focuses on analyzing captive portals. It provides an interface for interacting with captive portals directly through the app by gathering POST request bodies, headers, creating sessions, capturing screenshots, and analyzing their data collection and privacy using AI-powered analysis. Additionally, the app allows uploading analyzed data for further examination by our team.
> **Note:** The app is designed to work with physical devices only since it interacts with real captive portals.
